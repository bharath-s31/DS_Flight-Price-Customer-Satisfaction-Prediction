# **Flight Price and Customer Satisfaction Prediction**

---

## Overview
This project consists of two sub-projects designed to apply machine learning techniques in the **Travel and Tourism** and **Customer Experience** domains. It combines data preprocessing, machine learning model training, and interactive visualization using **Streamlit** with model tracking via **MLflow**.

## Project 1: Flight Price Prediction (Regression)

### **Skills Takeaway**
 - Python
 - Streamlit
 - Machine Learning
 - Data Analysis
 - MLflow

### **Problem Statement**
Build an end-to-end system to predict flight ticket prices based on multiple factors, including departure time, source, destination, and airline type. 

### **Business Use Cases**
1. Helping travelers plan trips by predicting flight prices.
2. Assisting travel agencies with price optimization.
3. Enabling businesses to budget travel expenses.
4. Supporting airlines in optimizing pricing strategies.

### **Approach**
1. **Data Preprocessing**
   - Load and clean the dataset.
   - Feature engineering (e.g., calculate price per minute).
   - Convert date and time columns into usable formats.

2. **Model Training**
   - Perform EDA to uncover trends.
   - Train regression models (e.g., Linear Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost).
   - Integrate MLflow for experiment tracking and model registry.

3. **Streamlit App**
   - Build an app for visualizing flight trends and predicting prices.
   - Features: route, airline, and time-based filters.

## Project 2: Customer Satisfaction Prediction (Classification)

### **Skills Takeaway**
- Python, Machine Learning, Streamlit, Classification Models, MLflow

### **Problem Statement**
Develop a classification system to predict customer satisfaction levels based on feedback, demographics, and service ratings.

### **Business Use Cases**
1. Enhancing customer retention strategies.
2. Providing actionable insights for improving services.
3. Identifying target customer groups for marketing campaigns.

### **Approach**
1. **Data Preprocessing**
   - Handle missing values and encode categorical variables.
   - Normalize numerical features for consistent scaling.

2. **Model Training**
   - Perform EDA to identify feature relationships.
   - Train classification models (e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting).
   - Log metrics (accuracy, F1-score) using MLflow.

3. **Streamlit App**
   - Interactive app to visualize satisfaction trends.
   - Input customer data and predict satisfaction levels.

## Streamlit Dashboard Features
- **Multi-Page Interface**:
  - Separate pages for Flight Price Prediction and Customer Satisfaction Prediction.
- **Interactive Visualizations**:
  - View trends for both projects with dynamic charts.
- **User Input Forms**:
  - Input flight or customer details for prediction.
- **Filters**:
  - Route, airline, and time filters for flight predictions.
  - Demographics and service-related filters for satisfaction predictions.

---

## Datasets
1. **Flight Price Dataset** (`Flight_Price.csv`):
   - Features: Airline, Source, Destination, Date of Journey, Route, etc.

2. **Customer Satisfaction Dataset** (`Passenger_Satisfaction.csv`):
   - Features: Gender, Customer Type, Age, Travel Type, Service Ratings, etc.

---

## Technical Highlights
- **MLflow**: Model tracking and experiment logging for both regression and classification tasks.
- **Streamlit**: Unified app for visualizing results and predictions.
- **Python**: Data preprocessing, feature engineering, and machine learning.
